You work for a company that has decided to introduce new pricing plans (Bronze, Silver, and Gold). The UI designer has come up with the new designs for the pricing plans page, however the APIs for the new plans is not ready. As a frontend developer, build a one page application that allows a user to subscribe to one of the new plans (borrow from any pricing plans design) whilst mocking the expected response from the API.


Main Requirements:

1. create 3 pricing plans 
2. subscription buttons for each plan
3. mock api fetch calls within each button
