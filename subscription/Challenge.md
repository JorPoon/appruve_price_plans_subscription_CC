You work for a company that has decided to introduce new pricing plans (Bronze, Silver, and Gold). The UI designer has come up with the new designs for the pricing plans page, however the APIs for the new plans is not ready. As a frontend developer, build a one page application that allows a user to subscribe to one of the new plans (borrow from any pricing plans design) whilst mocking the expected response from the API.


Main Requirements:

1. create 3 pricing plans 
2. subscription buttons for each plan
3. mock api fetch calls within each button


After 2 hours:
1. file structure / dependencies added
2. General flow/route of application created
3. minimal styling
4. made axios call to url to store data (get call)


Still needs to be worked on:
1. Styling
2. make axios post call to confirm subscription plan
3. User login / signup (need to make api calls to complete these too.
